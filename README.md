# Driver-Drowsiness-Detection-using-CNN
This project aimed to develop a system that could detect drowsiness in drivers based on their eye movements. The system uses a deep learning model, ResNet50, to analyze the driver's eye movements and classify them as either open or closed. The system alerts the driver if they are showing signs of drowsiness.
